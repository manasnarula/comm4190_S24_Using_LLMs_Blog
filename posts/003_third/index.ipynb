      "Here are 10 mid cap public stocks that are potential candidates for short selling, along with a brief rationale and anticipated price in 6 months based on current financial trends and market conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Airbnb Inc. (ABNB)**\n",
      "   - Current Price: $160.00\n",
      "   - Rationale: Airbnb's business heavily relies on travel and tourism, both of which have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As travel restrictions continue and economic uncertainty persists, Airbnb's revenue is likely to remain under pressure.\n",
      "   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $120.00\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER)**\n",
      "   - Current Price: $44.50\n",
      "   - Rationale: With ongoing regulatory challenges, labor disputes, and increasing competition in the ride-sharing and food delivery markets, Uber faces operational and profitability concerns in the medium term.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL)**\n",
      "   - Current Price: $21.10\n",
      "   - Rationale: The airline industry continues to face uncertainty due to the pandemic-induced travel restrictions and reduced demand for air travel. American Airlines' high debt levels and operating expenses further weaken its financial outlook.\n",
      "   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $16.00\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Carnival Corporation & Plc (CCL)**\n",
      "   - Current Price: $22.75\n",
      "   - Rationale: Cruise operators like Carnival have experienced significant disruptions to their operations due to the pandemic. With ongoing concerns about virus outbreaks onboard and limited resumption of cruises, Carnival's revenue generation remains constrained.\n",
      "   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $18.00\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dropbox Inc. (DBX)**\n",
      "   - Current Price: $31.20\n",
      "   - Rationale: Dropbox faces intense competition in the cloud storage and collaboration space, which puts pressure on its pricing power and market share. Moreover, the shift towards remote work may lead to slower growth in paid user acquisition.\n",
      "   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $25.00\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **PagerDuty Inc. (PD)**\n",
      "   - Current Price: $40.75\n",
      "   - Rationale: PagerDuty operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving IT operations management sector. As businesses reassess their technology spending and investments, PagerDuty may face challenges in expanding its customer base.\n",

      "\n",
      "7. **Square Inc. (SQ)**\n",
      "   - Current Price: $250.60\n",
      "   - Rationale: Square's stock has rallied significantly, leading to a high valuation relative to its financial performance. As macroeconomic conditions change and competition intensifies in the digital payments industry, there may be downward pressure on Square's stock price.\n",
      "   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $200.00\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Wendy's Company (WEN)**\n",
      "   - Current Price: $19.40\n",
      "   - Rationale: Wendy's faces challenges in its fast-food segment, with increased competition, changing consumer preferences, and cost pressures affecting its profitability. Slower sales recovery compared to peers may impact Wendy's stock performance.\n",
      "   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $15.00\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Under Armour Inc. (UAA)**\n",
      "   - Current Price: $21.80\n",

      "\n",
      "10. **Nordstrom Inc. (JWN)**\n",
      "    - Current Price: $26.90\n",
      "    - Rationale: Nordstrom operates in the competitive retail sector, facing challenges from online competitors and shifting consumer preferences. The company's high debt levels and store closures may impact its ability to sustain profitability.\n",
