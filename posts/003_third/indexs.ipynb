    "We've seen LLMs tackle a lot of tasks with surprising adeptness. But how do they fare when venturing into the complex and fairly unpredictable world of financial markets? Can GPT-3 act like a hedge fund manager?\n",
    "\n",
    "I tasked GPT-3.5, which is not specifically \"trained\" in the ins and outs of investing, with recommending 10 mid-cap public stocks to buy and hold for the long term, as well as 10 stocks to short. The goal was to assess not only the model's ability to give solid investment advice but also to understand its underlying rationale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given GPT-3.5's last training data up to September 2021, this experiment offers a unique opportunity to analyze the model's insights against the subsequent market developments up until this point. It's a test of whether an AI, without real-time market data or the ability to analyze financial statements in the way humans do, can still uncover valuable investment strategies through its pre-existing knowledge.\n",
