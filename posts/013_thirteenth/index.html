<li><p>Global Awareness: Climate change policies and global cooperation are deeply embedded into everyday life, influencing consumption habits and career choices.</p>
<p><em>Interesting things I noted:</em></p>
<pre><code> - UBI? I heard Sam Altman talking about it, and though it seems like a good idea to counter rapid AI development, seems a little communist?
 - ESG taken to the max, too. I kind of doubt that but could also see it happening
 - Elon Musk's space exploration/colonization goals in full swing
 - I did a project on the future development of brain-computer interfaces and its potential, and the positives I outlined align very closely with these predictions
 - The average day section certainly demonstrates IoT becoming almost fully integrated
 - 4-day workweek is the norm</code></pre></li>

<p><em>Interesting things I noted:</em></p>
<pre><code>    - AGI is real. But it seems at this point in time, the world is still trying to chase the "enhance, not replace" approach
    - Decentralized government is something that could be hard to fathom in our current world state, but I could see it happening with such rapid advancements in many different fields. It's interesting that GPT is also suggesting a gloabal economy. I wonder how decentralized government, global economy would actually work in practice 
    - Mind uploading? Digital immortality? Crazy and scary, but definitely very possible 
    - "Commuting is largely a concept of the past." I wonder if this means nobody owns cars and what the vibe around cars will be. Status and wealth, practicality?
    - Doubt there will be normalized "Well-being checks"</code></pre>

</ol>
<p><em>Interesting things I noted:</em></p>
<pre><code>    - I think right now, we assume that a fully developed AGI will be the entity that surpasses humans in most capacities, but I have never heard ASI before. Wonder if its just the name, or if GPT is predicting even further development, which could certainly spell the end of humanity sooner than later
    - Human colonization on other planets! Fully achieved Elon's goal, and we're not just inhabiting these planets, but utilizing them so efficiently, to the max 
    - Planetary governance seems like the Illuminati-like cult people like to speculate that we already have 
    - At this point, we are moving beyond Sapiens with all the bioengineering and brain-computer interfaces. 150 year+ lifespans. The ethical dilemmas will go crazy
    - I feel like even in our current world, it is extremely hard to fathom what a seamlessly integrated physical and digital reality would look like</code></pre>
