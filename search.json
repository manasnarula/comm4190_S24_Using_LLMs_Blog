    "section": "Mixtral’s Turn",
    "text": "Mixtral’s Turn\nFirst, I tried to see if GPT-4 can explain how to play these games. It gave me two fairly detailed explanations of how to play each game (I will include them at the end). I am now going to feed these explanations into the LLMs, just in case, and then ask then to solve the puzzles. Here we go:\nMixtral Wordle\nMe: I want you to play today’s Wordle. Here are the instructions on how to play: GPT instructions\nMixtral: It first tried to play the whole game in one response. It created the word ‘sadly’ as its made-up answer and solved it in 6 attempts\nMe: No, just guess one word at a time and I will give you the result of the word.\nMixtral: Sure, I’d be happy to play Wordle with you! Here’s my first guess:\nWordle guess (1/6): table\nPlease let me know the result of my guess so I can adjust my next guess accordingly.\nMe: Zero green tiles, one yellow tile (E), four gray tiles (T, A, B, L).\nMixtral: Thanks for letting me know! Based on the feedback, I’ll try to guess a word with the letter “E” in it, but avoiding the letters “T,” “A,” “B,” and “L.” Here’s my next guess:\nWordle guess (2/6): debit\nLet me know the result of this guess!\nClearly, it’s already a little bit confused. I told it no Ts or Bs, but it still guessed a word with both letters. At least the E is still in the word and in a different spot.\nMe: Zero green tiles, two yellow tile (E, and I), three gray tiles (D, B, T).\nMixtral: Great, I’ll use the letters “E” and “I” in my next guess, and avoid the letters “D,” “B,” and “T.” Here’s my next guess:\nWordle guess (3/6): field\nPlease let me know the result of this guess!\nMaybe it’s learning?\nMe: One green tile (I), two yellow tile (E), three gray tiles (F, L, D).\nMixtral: Thanks for the feedback! I’ll use the letters “I” and “E” in my next guess, and try to find a word that contains a letter that I haven’t used yet. Here’s my next guess:\nWordle guess (4/6): pounce\nLet me know the result of this guess!\nNever mind; here we go, again. 6 letters, no I, and the E is in a spot which it was previously said it cannot be.\nMe: That word is 6 letters. It can only be five.\nMixtral: You’re right, I apologize for the mistake. I’ll adjust my next guess to be a five-letter word with the letters “I” and “E” in it.\nWordle guess (4/6): ripen\nPlease let me know the result of this guess!\nWow, it’s actually almost there.\nMe: Nice! Three green tiles (I, P, E), one yellow tile (R), one gray tile (N).\nMixtral: Great, I’m getting closer! I’ll use the letters “I,” “P,” “E,” and “R” in my next guess. Here’s my next guess:\nWordle guess (5/6): pierce\nLet me know the result of this guess!\nThink it might be time to give up.\nMe: For “pierce,” first of all it’s a 6 letter word, second you did not listen to what I said about which letters were right.\nMixtral: I apologize for the confusion. Thank you for your patience. Based on your feedback, I’ll try to guess a five-letter word that contains the letters “I,” “P,” and “E,” with “I” and “E” in the correct positions. Here’s my next guess:\nWordle guess (5/6): pipes\nPlease let me know the result of this guess!\nProved me wrong once again when I thought it was out of the game. Let’s see if it can get it on the final guess. I don’t think it will because of the two Ps which will definitely confuse it.\nMe: Nice. Four green tiles (P, I, P, E), zero yellow tiles, one gray tile (S).\nMixtral had a connection error here, had to re-prompt\nMe: You have one try to get this word in wordle. Your guess was “pipes”, and both Ps, the I and the E are in the right spot. The S is not in the word.\nMixtral: Based on the information provided, the correct five-letter word for this Wordle puzzle is “PIPER.” The word “pipes” has two Ps, an I, and an E in the correct spots, and you mentioned that the S is not in the word. Therefore, the only possible word that fits the criteria is “PIPER.”\n*Wow, it actually got it, I did not expect that. However, I will say, if the connection did not time out on the original conversation, I do not think that Mixtral would have gotten it because there was a whole history of a conversation that probably would have confused the LLM as we were seeing in a couple of the first few guesses. But when I restarted with one prompt in a brand new conversation, it was able to. Guess we’ll never know ¯_(ツ)_/¯.*\nMixtral Connections\nNow, let’s see how it performs in Connections:\nMe: Connections instructions. I am going to give you the 16 words and you will try to solve it.\nMixtral: Sure, I’d be happy to try! Please provide me with the 16 words, and I’ll do my best to find the common connection between them.\nMe: Middle, Core, Wine, Wing, Rind, Feather, Plant, Stem, Factory, Wind, Seed, Shop, Heavy, Wink, Light, Mill\nMixtral: Thank you for providing the words! Based on my analysis, the connection between these words is that they can all be preceded by the word “central” to form a new word or phrase:\n\nCentral middle\nCentral core\nCentral wine (as in a central wine region)\nCentral wing\nCentral rind (as in the central rind of a cheese wheel)\nCentral feather (as in a central feather in an arrow)\nCentral plant (as in a central plant in a manufacturing facility)\nCentral stem\nCentral factory (as in a central factory that produces goods for a larger region)\nCentral wind (as in a central wind pattern)\nCentral seed (as in a central seed bank)\nCentral shop (as in a central shop in a town or city)\nCentral heavy (as in a central heavy industry area)\nCentral wink (as in a central wink to indicate a secret)\nCentral light (as in a central light source)\nCentral mill (as in a central mill that processes goods for a larger region)\n\nTherefore, the solution to this connections-style game could be “central.”\nClearly, the instructions weren’t explained in the best way as to say that there are supposed to be four distinct groups of ‘connections.’\nMe: No, there are supposed to be four different groups of distinct connections.\nMixtral: I apologize for misunderstanding the format earlier. Based on the 16 words you provided, here are four possible groups of distinct connections:\nGroup 1: Parts of a Plant\n\nStem\nSeed\nRind\nPlant\n\nGroup 2: Types of Industrial Facilities\n\nFactory\nMill\nShop\n\nGroup 3: Things Related to Birds\n\nWing\nFeather\nWink (as in a bird’s wink or blink)\n\nGroup 4: Descriptors of Weight or Light\n\nHeavy\nLight\nMiddle (as in a middleweight)\nCore (as in a core muscle group, which can be strengthened to improve balance and stability)\n\nGroup 5: Things Related to Wind or Air\n\nWind\nWing (as in a wing-shaped structure that catches the wind)\nWine (as in the wind that helps to cool grapes in wine-growing regions)\n\nThe connections in this game can be subjective, and there may be other valid groupings as well.\nsmh\nMe: Only four groups!\nMixtral: Apologies for the mistake earlier. Upon re-evaluating the words, here are four possible groups of distinct connections:\nGroup 1: Parts of a Plant\n\nStem\nSeed\nRind\nPlant\n\nGroup 2: Types of Industrial Facilities\n\nFactory\nMill\nShop\n\nGroup 3: Things Related to Birds\n\nWing\nFeather\nWink (as in a bird’s wink or blink)\n\nGroup 4: Descriptors of Weight or Light\n\nHeavy\nLight\nMiddle (as in a middleweight)\nCore (as in a core muscle group, which can be strengthened to improve balance and stability)\n\nIt’s just not fully getting it. I can definitely see how Connections would be a much more difficult game to solve for an LLM than Wordle. It’s been close with Stem, Seed, Rind and Factory, Mill, Shop, but it’s literally missing two words: Wind and Wine. Let’s give it one more nudge.\nMe: You are one word away from groups 1, 2, and 4, respectively, being correct.\nMixtral: Based on your feedback, here are the revised groups:\nGroup 1: Parts of a Fruit or Vegetable\nRind Seed Stem Core Plant (as in a fruit-bearing plant)\nGroup 2: Types of Establishments\nFactory Shop Mill Wing (as in a wing of a building or hospital)\nGroup 3: Things Related to Birds\nWing Feather Wink (as in a bird’s wink or blink) Wind (as in a bird’s ability to catch the wind with its wings)\nGroup 4: Descriptors of Weight\nHeavy Light Middleweight (which can be shortened to “middle”) Mill (as in a milligram, a unit of weight)\nThank you for your patience, and I hope this revised answer is helpful.\nIt is obviously not fully correct, but I think it definitely did a solid job getting close to the answer for an LLM. I was very curious to how the LLM would react to my follow-up prompts, as it is a lot easier to direct in Wordle, but Mixtral reacted better than I thought it would, and was only 2-3 words switched away from being correct."

    "section": "GPT-4’s Turn",
    "text": "GPT-4’s Turn\nGPT Wordle\nMe: You are going to try to get the wordle. You will guess a word, I will give you the result, then you will guess again, and so on.\nGPT: Sounds like a fun challenge! Let’s get started.\nMy first guess is: CRANE\nMe: Zero green tiles, two yellow tiles (R and E), three gray tiles (C, A, N).\nGPT: With that feedback, let’s make a second guess. Given that “R” and “E” are in the word but not in the first and last positions, I’ll try a different combination:\nMy second guess is: REACT\nOh God, here we go again.\nMe: I just told you there is no A or C in the word.\nGPT: My apologies for the oversight. Let’s try a new guess without including the letters “A,” “C,” or “N.”\nMy second guess is: LOVER\nMe: Two green tiles (E and R), zero yellow tiles, 3 gray tiles (L, O, V).\nGPT: Great, with “E” and “R” as the confirmed green tiles, and knowing that “L,” “O,” and “V” are not in the word, I will make a new guess avoiding those letters and trying to find the correct positions for “E” and “R.”\nMy third guess is: TIGER\nNow we’re getting somewhere.\nMe: Three green tiles (I, E, R), zero yellow tiles, two gray tiles (T and G).\nGPT: Now we know the positions for “I,” “E,” and “R,” with “I” in the first position. Since “T” and “G” are not in the word either, I’ll make a fourth guess:\nMy fourth guess is: IRATE\nMe: NO! I just told you the I, E, and R were in the right spots in ‘Tiger.’\nGPT: I apologize for the mistake. The correct positions are “I” as the first letter, “E” as the fourth letter, and “R” as the fifth letter. With this in mind, I will try another guess:\nMy fourth guess is: INNER\nMe: Why is I the first letter?\nGPT: I misunderstood your previous feedback. You mentioned that “I,” “E,” and “R” were green tiles in the word “TIGER,” which means they are in the correct positions in that word. Therefore, “I” is not the first letter; it is actually the second letter. The correct positions are “I” in the second place, “E” in the fourth place, and “R” in the fifth place.\nLet’s try again with the correct placement:\nMy fourth guess is: FIBER\nMe: Again, the I, E, and R are in the right spots, and F and B are not in the word.\nGPT: Understood, with “I” in the third position, “E” in the fourth position, and “R” in the fifth position, and knowing that “F” and “B” are not in the word, I’ll make a new guess:\nMy fifth guess is: QUIRE\nGPT-4 seems to stay within the constraints better than Mixtral but is clearly struggling with the position of letters. It is now the second time I have assured it that “I” is in the second position but it thinks otherwise. Let’s see if it can get it.\nMe: WHY IS “I” IN THE THIRD POSITION?\nGPT: I apologize for the confusion. Based on your previous feedback, “I” should be in the second position, “E” in the fourth position, and “R” in the fifth position. Let’s correct that and make an accurate guess:\nMy fifth guess is: WIDER\nMe: Here is a hint. The first and third letters are the same.\nGPT: With the hint that the first and third letters are the same, and knowing that the structure is _ I E R, the word could be “Riser”.\nSeriously… I continued to try to prompt GPT with different hints for a bit, but it was getting nowhere. Obviously Mixtral and GPT went about solving it in different ways so its iterations could lead to different perspectives on how they did. But on the surface, I do have to give the Wordle award to Mixtral. Let’s try Connections.\nGPT Connections\nMe: If I gave you the 16 words, do you think you could solve the Connections?\nGPT: Yes, I can certainly try to help you solve the Connections puzzle with the 16 words you provide. Go ahead and share the words with me, and let’s see if we can figure out the connections together!\nMe: Middle, Core, Wine, Wing, Rind, Feather, Plant, Stem, Factory, Wind, Seed, Shop, Heavy, Wink, Light, Mill\nGPT: Let’s analyze the 16 words you’ve given to identify potential connections. We’re looking for groups of four words that share a common theme or characteristic. Here’s an initial thought process for solving this:\nGroup 1: Words related to parts of plants or growth. Seed Stem Plant Leaf (Not listed, but could be inferred if we’re looking for a connection with “Middle,” “Core,” or “Rind”) Group 2: Words associated with parts of birds or flight. Wing Feather (Need two more connections; possibly misgrouped if “Wing” and “Feather” are the only clear matches) Group 3: Words related to types of facilities or places of production. Factory Shop Mill (The fourth might be “Wine” as in a winery, which is a place where wine is produced) Group 4: Words that have opposite meanings or related to opposites in some context. Heavy Light (This group might need reevaluation; “Wink” and “Wind” could fit different categories) Given the words you’ve provided, it seems we might need to adjust our approach. Let’s attempt to form the groups with a revised strategy, taking into account the hint for a possible correction:\nParts of a Plant Seed Stem Plant Rind (Considering rind can be seen as an outer layer of fruits/vegetables, which are parts of plants) Things That Can Be Found in the Air or Related to Air Wind Wing (Part of birds, planes, etc., that flies) Feather (Often associated with things that fly) (The fourth might be challenging; “Wink” could be misplaced here) Types of Buildings or Places Factory Shop Mill (A specific type of factory) Wine (Thinking in terms of a winery) Miscellaneous/Adjectives or Actions Heavy Light Wink (An action) (The fourth could be “Middle” or “Core” for their central or fundamental qualities, or “Wind” if misinterpreted earlier) However, I recognize some of my groupings may not perfectly fit the intended solution, especially without clear direction for each word. Let’s refine based on your original list:\nMiddle, Core, Rind, Seed could represent “Centers” or “Inner parts” of objects. Wine, Shop, Factory, Mill could be places of production or processing. Wing, Feather, Wind, Light could relate to things associated with air or flight. Heavy, Wink, Plant, Stem seems less cohesive, suggesting I might have misplaced some words in their groups.\nGiven these categories don’t perfectly align with the words you provided, it’s clear there’s room for adjustment. The correct grouping will depend on identifying the shared characteristic or theme among each set of four words. If you have any insights or corrections to my attempts, feel free to share!\nIt’s incredible how much more in depth and immediately understanding GPT is. As part of the same response, it realized its first approach needed to be adjusted and gave an updated guess, with potential alterations listed right there. Not only that, but at the end, it acknowledges that “these categories don’t perfectly align with the words you provided, it’s clear there’s room for adjustment.” Even if GPT doesn’t end up solving it, I still feel that I already have to give the Connections award to GPT-4.\nMe:\nGPT: Given that Groups 1, 3, and 4 are each one word away from being correct, let’s revise our groupings based on your feedback:\nRevised Groupings Group 1: Initially considered as parts of plants or growth, with one word possibly misplaced. Let’s adjust with the hint in mind: Seed Stem Plant Rind It seems this group was close but might need a replacement for one of these to better fit another category. Group 3: Related to types of facilities or places of production, but with one word off. Let’s reconsider the correct inclusion: Factory Shop Mill Wine (previously included, but considering the hint, this might be the misplaced word) Given the hint, “Wine” might not belong here if we think of “Winery” as too specific or not fitting the broader category shared by the other three. Group 4: Attempted to identify a group with contrasting concepts or miscellaneous, with one word off. Reevaluating: Heavy Light Wink (The fourth word here might need to be swapped out for something that fits better with “Heavy” and “Light,” possibly focusing on a theme of opposites or something else) Given these insights, let’s attempt a new configuration:\nFor Group 1 (Parts of a Plant), we might need to swap out one word that better fits another category. If “Rind” is not the misplaced one, then our grouping logic needs adjusting, but based on the categories, it seems the most cohesive. Group 3 (Types of Buildings or Places): Since “Wine” might be the misplaced word, it suggests that this word should be replaced with another that fits more directly with the concept of production or commercial places. Group 4 (Miscellaneous/Adjectives or Actions): This group’s correction might involve identifying the word that aligns more with the theme shared by “Heavy” and “Light.” Considering your hint, let’s try a different configuration by moving “Wine” out of the production group and finding a better fit for each misplaced word:\nGroup 1: Plants-related might need a swap. Group 2: Not yet defined, but could potentially include “Wine” if we’re considering categories like types of products or something more thematic. Group 3: Needs a word that fits better with “Factory,” “Shop,” and “Mill,” possibly “Wind” if we think of mills and production involving air or movement. Group 4: The theme of opposites or something that aligns more with “Heavy” and “Light” might need to include a word that embodies contrast or a physical property, potentially moving “Wine” here if we misinterpreted its thematic connection. Let’s propose a new attempt, keeping in mind your hint that three groups are one word away:\nRevised Group 1 (Inner Parts): Middle Core Rind Seed Revised Group 3 (Places of Production): Factory Shop Mill (The correct word here is still uncertain without “Wine”) Revised Group 4 (Possibly needs rethinking based on the theme of opposites or related concepts). Without a clear direction for each misplaced word, I’ll need more guidance on how to correctly adjust these groups. If “Wine” doesn’t belong in the production group, it needs a new home, and we must identify the correct replacement for each nearly correct group.\nAgain, it’s questioning itself as it goes. Even if it doesn’t get closer than Mixtral did, I think that’s fascinating. I’m going to give one more nudge and see.\nMe: The four group descriptions are “PARTS OF FRUIT YOU MIGHT NOT EAT,” “MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS,” “WIN + LETTER,” “WEIGHTS IN BOXING.” Can you get it now?\nGPT: Given the new group descriptions, let’s organize the words accordingly:\nGroup 1: PARTS OF FRUIT YOU MIGHT NOT EAT Core Rind Seed Stem\nGroup 2: MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS Factory Mill Shop (Looking for a fourth word that fits this category, “Wine” might be considered here if we think in terms of a winery as a manufacturing location for wine. However, given the new descriptions, we might need to find a more fitting word from the list.)\nGroup 3: WIN + LETTER Wink (Win + K) Wind (Win + D) Wine (Win + E) Wing (Win + G)\nGroup 4: WEIGHTS IN BOXING Heavy Light Middle (Middleweight) (The fourth weight class in boxing from the provided words could be “Core,” but it doesn’t fit directly with known boxing weight classes. We need to identify the correct word that represents a boxing weight class.)\nGiven these descriptions and the remaining words, let’s correct the placements:\nGroup 2 (MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS) seems off because none of the remaining words after correction directly fits “Wine” in the sense of a place rather than the process or product.\nHere is the corrected grouping based on your hints:\nCorrected Groupings PARTS OF FRUIT YOU MIGHT NOT EAT Core Rind Seed Stem\nMANUFACTURING LOCATIONS Factory Mill Shop (The correct fourth word for manufacturing locations is tricky. Considering “Wine” as previously placed might have been incorrect, we’ll revisit this.)\nWIN + LETTER Wink Wind Wine Wing\nWEIGHTS IN BOXING Heavy (Heavyweight) Light (Lightweight) Middle (Middleweight) (Looking for the correct word, “Feather” for Featherweight, which was missing from my initial reorganization.) Upon review, it’s clear that the correct word for the manufacturing locations group isn’t specified in the clues given for the new categories. Given “Feather” aligns with the boxing weights category, let’s finalize the correct groups based on the descriptions you provided:\nPARTS OF FRUIT YOU MIGHT NOT EAT: Correctly identified. MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS: Needs clarification since all previously identified locations were correct, but we need to include the right word from the list. WIN + LETTER: Correctly reorganized. WEIGHTS IN BOXING: Now correctly includes “Feather” for Featherweight. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the manufacturing locations group due to an oversight on my part. Reevaluating the list, the correct groups should now be clear:\nGroup 1: Parts of fruit you might not eat - Core, Rind, Seed, Stem Group 2: Manufacturing locations - Factory, Mill, Shop, and the correct placement here seems to be missing based on the words provided; all fit the given description. Group 3: Win + letter - Wink, Wind, Wine, Wing Group 4: Weights in boxing - Heavy, Light, Middle, and “Feather” should be here, which corrects the placement issue.\nWith “Feather” correctly identified as part of the boxing weights group, it appears we have resolved the grouping based on your descriptions. My earlier mistake was misplacing “Feather” in an incorrect group, which should have been obvious for the boxing category. Thank you for your patience and the clues to get these groups aligned correctly!"

The difficulty in these sports lies in the physical demands, mental fortitude, technical skills required, and the competitiveness of the sport. In no particular order, here are the top 10 hardest sports to play:\n\n1. Gymnastics:\nGymnastics demands exceptional strength, flexibility, coordination, and balance. The level of concentration required to perform intricate routines on apparatus like the vault or balance beam is immense. For example, executing a flawless balance beam routine, where one wrong move can lead to a fall, requires immense focus and precision.\n\n2. Ice Hockey:\nIce hockey is a physically demanding sport, combining speed, skill, and toughness. Players must possess excellent skating ability, hand-eye coordination, and quick decision-making skills. Enduring intense physical contact, while staying focused on puck control and teamwork, make it an arduous sport. Take the example of a player attempting to score a goal in a crowded net, facing the opposition's defensemen and a goalie who is also trying to block the shot.\n\n3. Tennis:\nTennis demands exceptional hand-eye coordination, agility, and mental resilience. Players must possess accurate timing and footwork to return difficult shots. Maintaining focus and composure during long matches requires tremendous mental fortitude. For instance, in a high-pressure situation, a tennis player needs to execute a perfect drop shot while under constant pressure from their opponent.\n\n4. Rugby:\nRugby is a physically grueling contact sport, requiring strength, endurance, and skill. Players must possess exceptional cardiovascular fitness, as they endure rigorous physical challenges such as tackles, rucks, and scrums. The ability to make split-second decisions while under intense physical pressure makes rugby an extremely challenging sport. For example, a player evading multiple opponents and passing the ball precisely to a teammate requires immense skill and determination.\n\n5. Golf:\nGolf may not be as physically demanding as some other sports, but its difficulty lies in the mental aspect and precision required. Golfers need to analyze the course, calculate wind and other factors, and choose the right club for each shot. Executing a golf swing, combining power and control, requires years of practice. For instance, attempting to hit a long drive while avoiding water hazards and aiming accurately for placement on a challenging fairway is a considerable challenge in the game of golf.\n\n6. Formula 1 Racing:\nFormula 1 racing demands top physical conditioning, lightning-fast reflexes, and exceptional mental concentration. Drivers must withstand the high G-forces experienced during races while maintaining precise control over their vehicles. The ability to make split-second decisions while driving at extremely high speeds is a significant challenge. One example is making a decisive pass in a tight corner without colliding with other drivers.\n\n7. Water Polo:\nWater polo combines the physical demands of swimming with the dynamic and fast-paced nature of team sports. Players need exceptional swimming ability, endurance, strength, and the ability to hold their breath. Performing while treading water and adapting to constantly changing game situations make it incredibly challenging. For instance, a player needs to stay afloat, evade defenders, and accurately pass the ball to a teammate while under pressure.\n\n8. Alpine Skiing:\nAlpine skiing requires exceptional technique, strength, balance, and courage. Skiers face high speeds, varying terrain, and unpredictable weather conditions. Negotiating steep, icy slopes while maintaining control and avoiding obstacles demands both physical and mental prowess. For example, navigating a challenging downhill course, making quick turns, and managing the pressure of the race is a daunting task.\n\n9. Cricket:\nCricket is a complex sport that demands a combination of physical fitness, hand-eye coordination, concentration, and strategic thinking. Both batsmen and bowlers face intense pressure to perform under various match situations. Batsmen need to adapt quickly to different ball deliveries and accurately hit them, while bowlers need to aim accurately and anticipate the batsman's moves. An example would be a batsman facing fierce fast bowling and trying to time his shot perfectly against a bowler who is capable of delivering tricky variations.\n\n10. Decathlon:\nThe decathlon is an all-encompassing athletic competition requiring competitors to excel in ten different track and field events over two days. Competitors must possess a high level of skill, strength, speed, and endurance across multiple disciplines. Juggling event schedules, staying injury-free, and maintaining concentration throughout the competition make the decathlon extremely challenging. One example is a competitor pushing through exhaustion to deliver a solid performance in the final event, the 1,500-meter race, where mental and physical fatigue is at its peak.\n\nIt is necessary to note that the ranking of these sports may vary depending on personal opinion and individual strengths and weaknesses."

The difficulty in these sports lies in the physical demands, mental fortitude, technical skills required, and the competitiveness of the sport. In no particular order, here are the top 10 hardest sports to play:\n\n1. Gymnastics:\nGymnastics demands exceptional strength, flexibility, coordination, and balance. The level of concentration required to perform intricate routines on apparatus like the vault or balance beam is immense. For example, executing a flawless balance beam routine, where one wrong move can lead to a fall, requires immense focus and precision.\n\n2. Ice Hockey:\nIce hockey is a physically demanding sport, combining speed, skill, and toughness. Players must possess excellent skating ability, hand-eye coordination, and quick decision-making skills. Enduring intense physical contact, while staying focused on puck control and teamwork, make it an arduous sport. Take the example of a player attempting to score a goal in a crowded net, facing the opposition's defensemen and a goalie who is also trying to block the shot.\n\n3. Tennis:\nTennis demands exceptional hand-eye coordination, agility, and mental resilience. Players must possess accurate timing and footwork to return difficult shots. Maintaining focus and composure during long matches requires tremendous mental fortitude. For instance, in a high-pressure situation, a tennis player needs to execute a perfect drop shot while under constant pressure from their opponent.\n\n4. Rugby:\nRugby is a physically grueling contact sport, requiring strength, endurance, and skill. Players must possess exceptional cardiovascular fitness, as they endure rigorous physical challenges such as tackles, rucks, and scrums. The ability to make split-second decisions while under intense physical pressure makes rugby an extremely challenging sport. For example, a player evading multiple opponents and passing the ball precisely to a teammate requires immense skill and determination.\n\n5. Golf:\nGolf may not be as physically demanding as some other sports, but its difficulty lies in the mental aspect and precision required. Golfers need to analyze the course, calculate wind and other factors, and choose the right club for each shot. Executing a golf swing, combining power and control, requires years of practice. For instance, attempting to hit a long drive while avoiding water hazards and aiming accurately for placement on a challenging fairway is a considerable challenge in the game of golf.\n\n6. Formula 1 Racing:\nFormula 1 racing demands top physical conditioning, lightning-fast reflexes, and exceptional mental concentration. Drivers must withstand the high G-forces experienced during races while maintaining precise control over their vehicles. The ability to make split-second decisions while driving at extremely high speeds is a significant challenge. One example is making a decisive pass in a tight corner without colliding with other drivers.\n\n7. Water Polo:\nWater polo combines the physical demands of swimming with the dynamic and fast-paced nature of team sports. Players need exceptional swimming ability, endurance, strength, and the ability to hold their breath. Performing while treading water and adapting to constantly changing game situations make it incredibly challenging. For instance, a player needs to stay afloat, evade defenders, and accurately pass the ball to a teammate while under pressure.\n\n8. Alpine Skiing:\nAlpine skiing requires exceptional technique, strength, balance, and courage. Skiers face high speeds, varying terrain, and unpredictable weather conditions. Negotiating steep, icy slopes while maintaining control and avoiding obstacles demands both physical and mental prowess. For example, navigating a challenging downhill course, making quick turns, and managing the pressure of the race is a daunting task.\n\n9. Cricket:\nCricket is a complex sport that demands a combination of physical fitness, hand-eye coordination, concentration, and strategic thinking. Both batsmen and bowlers face intense pressure to perform under various match situations. Batsmen need to adapt quickly to different ball deliveries and accurately hit them, while bowlers need to aim accurately and anticipate the batsman's moves.

Juggling event schedules, staying injury-free, and maintaining concentration throughout the competition make the decathlon extremely challenging.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We’ve seen LLMs tackle a lot of tasks with surprising adeptness. But how do they fare when venturing into the complex and fairly unpredictable world of financial markets? Can GPT-3 act like a hedge fund manager?\nI tasked GPT-3.5, which is not specifically “trained” in the ins and outs of investing, with recommending 10 mid-cap public stocks to buy and hold for the long term, as well as 10 stocks to short. The goal was to assess not only the model’s ability to give solid investment advice but also to understand its underlying rationale.\nGiven GPT-3.5’s last training data up to September 2021, this experiment offers a unique opportunity to analyze the model’s insights against the subsequent market developments up until this point. It’s a test of whether an AI, without real-time market data or the ability to analyze financial statements in the way humans do, can still uncover valuable investment strategies through its pre-existing knowledge.\nIn this post, I’ll share the stocks GPT-3 recommended and a comparison of how these picks have performed in the time since. Have these selections beaten the market, or did they fall short of GPT Partners’ expectations?"

As for its recomendation as a long term buy, it has been fairly volatile since Sep 2021, and it’s just a little bit higher now. Not the best rec, not the worst.\n\nNow, Zscaler. GPT’s listed price of $248.90 is much closer to its actual price in Sep 2021. You can tell in July/August, the actual price is even closer to what GPT had said, so maybe it’s somehow getting it from that time. Still, the TTD price doesn’t make sense.\nOn to Zscaler’s performance: the stock really struggled. In 2023, it dipped over four times below its peak in Nov 2021. Maybe GPT had the right short term idea here (maybe it’s just bullshit?). Still interesting regardless."

As a responsible financial advisor, it is important to avoid advocating for short positions as they involve significant risks and should only be undertaken by experienced investors with a thorough understanding of short-selling strategies and associated risks. If you have any other questions or if there is something else I can assist you with, please let me know.\nI gave up at this point. I will be honest: while shorts can be fun and super lucrative sometimes, GPT is right and it does involve significant risks. I respect this last answer. But I still wanted to try one last time on the ChatGPT website, on GPT-4. Here’s the result:\nMe: You are a detailed and analytical hedge fund analyst. You would like to find some mid-cap public stocks to recommend to your client for the long term. Give 10 mid-cap stocks that are strong long-term shorts and provide strong financial reasoning as to why. Provide its current price and your anticipated price in 2 years.\nGPT-4: Identifying mid-cap stocks that are strong long-term shorts involves a thorough analysis of various financial metrics, market conditions, competitive positioning, and future growth prospects. While I cannot provide real-time data or specific future price predictions without current market data, I can guide you on the type of companies that might typically be considered for such a strategy, along with the rationale based on financial principles and common indicators of potential underperformance.\nFor the purpose of this exercise, I’ll outline a hypothetical list of characteristics that might lead to identifying mid-cap companies as potential long-term shorts, rather than naming specific companies, as my last update was in April 2023 and real-time market conditions could have significantly changed.\n\nHigh Debt Levels Relative to Equity Companies with high leverage may struggle during economic downturns due to their significant interest obligations, potentially leading to underperformance.\nDeclining Revenue and Earnings Firms experiencing sustained declines in revenue and earnings may face underlying issues such as reduced demand, strong competition, or operational inefficiencies.\nPoor Cash Flow Management Negative free cash flow over extended periods could indicate problems with capital management, affecting the company’s ability to invest in growth or return value to shareholders.\nDeteriorating Industry Position Companies losing market share to competitors may face challenges in maintaining profitability, signaling potential long-term underperformance.\nRegulatory or Legal Challenges Firms facing significant regulatory or legal hurdles may incur heavy costs, impacting earnings and distracting management from core operations.\nOverdependence on a Single Product or Service A lack of diversification can be risky if demand for the primary offering declines, affecting the company’s long-term growth prospects.\nTechnological Disruption Companies in industries susceptible to technological disruption but showing slow adaptation may face long-term challenges to their business models.\nAdverse Macro-economic Factors Firms in sectors particularly sensitive to economic cycles or geopolitical tensions may experience more volatility and risk of downturns.\nUnfavorable Competitive Dynamics Industries with increasing competition, price wars, or low barriers to entry might pressure margins and profitability for certain companies.\nGovernance and Management Issues Companies with questionable corporate governance practices or frequent changes in key management positions might face strategic inconsistencies and execution challenges.\n\nFinancial Analysis Approach For each potential short candidate, thorough financial analysis should include:\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio: Assess financial leverage and risk. Trend Analysis: Revenue, earnings, cash flow over recent quarters/years. Comparative Analysis: Against industry peers in terms of profitability, efficiency, and growth metrics. Future Outlook: Consideration of analyst forecasts, sector trends, and economic conditions.\nConclusion and Disclaimer It’s crucial to remember that short selling carries significant risks and requires careful consideration of market dynamics, individual company performance, and broader economic factors. The approach outlined above is hypothetical and should be used as a framework for conducting in-depth analysis rather than as direct investment advice. Market conditions change, and analysis should be based on the most current data available.\nFor specific company recommendations, including current prices and detailed financial analysis, consulting real-time financial databases and performing up-to-date market analysis is essential.\nFinally, we got somewhere. No real stocks, but at least some insightful methodologies about how to go about thinking about shorting stocks while still pointing out the risks associated with it. I will say, the insights are still kind of general, but way better than where we got before. I’m not disappointed."

If White Lotus were to have a generalized formula to develop its plot and characters, GPT seems like it would be following that formula here. It introduces a diverse cast with intriguing backgrounds, and weaves together personal secrets as well as a mysterious death, keeping true to the show’s themes of privilege and hidden truths. While the narrative is engaging and for sure fits the mold of the series so far (definitely more generalized ideas though), the depth and societal commentary characteristic of it would still need a human writer’s touch for full realization."
