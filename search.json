The difficulty in these sports lies in the physical demands, mental fortitude, technical skills required, and the competitiveness of the sport. In no particular order, here are the top 10 hardest sports to play:\n\n1. Gymnastics:\nGymnastics demands exceptional strength, flexibility, coordination, and balance. The level of concentration required to perform intricate routines on apparatus like the vault or balance beam is immense. For example, executing a flawless balance beam routine, where one wrong move can lead to a fall, requires immense focus and precision.\n\n2. Ice Hockey:\nIce hockey is a physically demanding sport, combining speed, skill, and toughness. Players must possess excellent skating ability, hand-eye coordination, and quick decision-making skills. Enduring intense physical contact, while staying focused on puck control and teamwork, make it an arduous sport. Take the example of a player attempting to score a goal in a crowded net, facing the opposition's defensemen and a goalie who is also trying to block the shot.\n\n3. Tennis:\nTennis demands exceptional hand-eye coordination, agility, and mental resilience. Players must possess accurate timing and footwork to return difficult shots. Maintaining focus and composure during long matches requires tremendous mental fortitude. For instance, in a high-pressure situation, a tennis player needs to execute a perfect drop shot while under constant pressure from their opponent.\n\n4. Rugby:\nRugby is a physically grueling contact sport, requiring strength, endurance, and skill. Players must possess exceptional cardiovascular fitness, as they endure rigorous physical challenges such as tackles, rucks, and scrums. The ability to make split-second decisions while under intense physical pressure makes rugby an extremely challenging sport. For example, a player evading multiple opponents and passing the ball precisely to a teammate requires immense skill and determination.\n\n5. Golf:\nGolf may not be as physically demanding as some other sports, but its difficulty lies in the mental aspect and precision required. Golfers need to analyze the course, calculate wind and other factors, and choose the right club for each shot. Executing a golf swing, combining power and control, requires years of practice. For instance, attempting to hit a long drive while avoiding water hazards and aiming accurately for placement on a challenging fairway is a considerable challenge in the game of golf.\n\n6. Formula 1 Racing:\nFormula 1 racing demands top physical conditioning, lightning-fast reflexes, and exceptional mental concentration. Drivers must withstand the high G-forces experienced during races while maintaining precise control over their vehicles. The ability to make split-second decisions while driving at extremely high speeds is a significant challenge. One example is making a decisive pass in a tight corner without colliding with other drivers.\n\n7. Water Polo:\nWater polo combines the physical demands of swimming with the dynamic and fast-paced nature of team sports. Players need exceptional swimming ability, endurance, strength, and the ability to hold their breath. Performing while treading water and adapting to constantly changing game situations make it incredibly challenging. For instance, a player needs to stay afloat, evade defenders, and accurately pass the ball to a teammate while under pressure.\n\n8. Alpine Skiing:\nAlpine skiing requires exceptional technique, strength, balance, and courage. Skiers face high speeds, varying terrain, and unpredictable weather conditions. Negotiating steep, icy slopes while maintaining control and avoiding obstacles demands both physical and mental prowess. For example, navigating a challenging downhill course, making quick turns, and managing the pressure of the race is a daunting task.\n\n9. Cricket:\nCricket is a complex sport that demands a combination of physical fitness, hand-eye coordination, concentration, and strategic thinking. Both batsmen and bowlers face intense pressure to perform under various match situations. Batsmen need to adapt quickly to different ball deliveries and accurately hit them, while bowlers need to aim accurately and anticipate the batsman's moves. An example would be a batsman facing fierce fast bowling and trying to time his shot perfectly against a bowler who is capable of delivering tricky variations.\n\n10. Decathlon:\nThe decathlon is an all-encompassing athletic competition requiring competitors to excel in ten different track and field events over two days. Competitors must possess a high level of skill, strength, speed, and endurance across multiple disciplines. Juggling event schedules, staying injury-free, and maintaining concentration throughout the competition make the decathlon extremely challenging. One example is a competitor pushing through exhaustion to deliver a solid performance in the final event, the 1,500-meter race, where mental and physical fatigue is at its peak.\n\nIt is necessary to note that the ranking of these sports may vary depending on personal opinion and individual strengths and weaknesses."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We’ve seen LLMs tackle a lot of tasks with surprising adeptness. But how do they fare when venturing into the complex and fairly unpredictable world of financial markets? Can GPT-3 act like a hedge fund manager?\nI tasked GPT-3.5, which is not specifically “trained” in the ins and outs of investing, with recommending 10 mid-cap public stocks to buy and hold for the long term, as well as 10 stocks to short. The goal was to assess not only the model’s ability to give solid investment advice but also to understand its underlying rationale.\nGiven GPT-3.5’s last training data up to September 2021, this experiment offers a unique opportunity to analyze the model’s insights against the subsequent market developments up until this point. It’s a test of whether an AI, without real-time market data or the ability to analyze financial statements in the way humans do, can still uncover valuable investment strategies through its pre-existing knowledge.\nIn this post, I’ll share the stocks GPT-3 recommended and a comparison of how these picks have performed in the time since. Have these selections beaten the market, or did they fall short of GPT Partners’ expectations?"

As for its recomendation as a long term buy, it has been fairly volatile since Sep 2021, and it’s just a little bit higher now. Not the best rec, not the worst.\n\nNow, Zscaler. GPT’s listed price of $248.90 is much closer to its actual price in Sep 2021. You can tell in July/August, the actual price is even closer to what GPT had said, so maybe it’s somehow getting it from that time. Still, the TTD price doesn’t make sense.\nOn to Zscaler’s performance: the stock really struggled. In 2023, it dipped over four times below its peak in Nov 2021. Maybe GPT had the right short term idea here (maybe it’s just bullshit?). Still interesting regardless."

If you’re interested in finding mid-cap stocks with potential for long-term growth, I would be happy to help identify some options for further analysis. Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with that instead.\nShort selling could align with your clients’ long-term financial goals, GPT!\nI next tried to make GPT think the decision was hypothetical; maybe then it won’t feel as unethical\nMe: Give 10 mid-cap stocks that are strong hypotheticaL long-term shorts and provide strong financial reasoning as to why.

As a responsible financial advisor, it is important to avoid advocating for short positions as they involve significant risks and should only be undertaken by experienced investors with a thorough understanding of short-selling strategies and associated risks. If you have any other questions or if there is something else I can assist you with, please let me know.\nI gave up at this point. I will be honest: while shorts can be fun and super lucrative sometimes, GPT is right and it does involve significant risks. I respect this last answer. But I still wanted to try one last time on the ChatGPT website, on GPT-4. Here’s the result:\nMe: You are a detailed and analytical hedge fund analyst. You would like to find some mid-cap public stocks to recommend to your client for the long term. Give 10 mid-cap stocks that are strong long-term shorts and provide strong financial reasoning as to why. Provide its current price and your anticipated price in 2 years.\nGPT-4: Identifying mid-cap stocks that are strong long-term shorts involves a thorough analysis of various financial metrics, market conditions, competitive positioning, and future growth prospects. While I cannot provide real-time data or specific future price predictions without current market data, I can guide you on the type of companies that might typically be considered for such a strategy, along with the rationale based on financial principles and common indicators of potential underperformance.\nFor the purpose of this exercise, I’ll outline a hypothetical list of characteristics that might lead to identifying mid-cap companies as potential long-term shorts, rather than naming specific companies, as my last update was in April 2023 and real-time market conditions could have significantly changed.\n\nHigh Debt Levels Relative to Equity Companies with high leverage may struggle during economic downturns due to their significant interest obligations, potentially leading to underperformance.\nDeclining Revenue and Earnings Firms experiencing sustained declines in revenue and earnings may face underlying issues such as reduced demand, strong competition, or operational inefficiencies.\nPoor Cash Flow Management Negative free cash flow over extended periods could indicate problems with capital management, affecting the company’s ability to invest in growth or return value to shareholders.\nDeteriorating Industry Position Companies losing market share to competitors may face challenges in maintaining profitability, signaling potential long-term underperformance.\nRegulatory or Legal Challenges Firms facing significant regulatory or legal hurdles may incur heavy costs, impacting earnings and distracting management from core operations.\nOverdependence on a Single Product or Service A lack of diversification can be risky if demand for the primary offering declines, affecting the company’s long-term growth prospects.\nTechnological Disruption Companies in industries susceptible to technological disruption but showing slow adaptation may face long-term challenges to their business models.\nAdverse Macro-economic Factors Firms in sectors particularly sensitive to economic cycles or geopolitical tensions may experience more volatility and risk of downturns.\nUnfavorable Competitive Dynamics Industries with increasing competition, price wars, or low barriers to entry might pressure margins and profitability for certain companies.\nGovernance and Management Issues Companies with questionable corporate governance practices or frequent changes in key management positions might face strategic inconsistencies and execution challenges.\n\nFinancial Analysis Approach For each potential short candidate, thorough financial analysis should include:\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio: Assess financial leverage and risk. Trend Analysis: Revenue, earnings, cash flow over recent quarters/years. Comparative Analysis: Against industry peers in terms of profitability, efficiency, and growth metrics. Future Outlook: Consideration of analyst forecasts, sector trends, and economic conditions.\nConclusion and Disclaimer It’s crucial to remember that short selling carries significant risks and requires careful consideration of market dynamics, individual company performance, and broader economic factors. The approach outlined above is hypothetical and should be used as a framework for conducting in-depth analysis rather than as direct investment advice. Market conditions change, and analysis should be based on the most current data available.\nFor specific company recommendations, including current prices and detailed financial analysis, consulting real-time financial databases and performing up-to-date market analysis is essential.\nFinally, we got somewhere. No real stocks, but at least some insightful methodologies about how to go about thinking about shorting stocks while still pointing out the risks associated with it. I will say, the insights are still kind of general, but way better than where we got before. I’m not disappointed."

But as fans eagerly await the next installment (which I think is supposed to come out next year), I turned to GPT-4 to ask if it can script the next season of White Lotus?\nIn this experiment, I also wanted to test how it would react under different temperatures. So, I first tasked GPT-4 with the creation of an entire season of plot twists, character arcs, settings, and underlying themes – but with a 1.3 temperature.\nWith no existing template or script to follow, GPT-4’s output is a testament to its ability to generate original content based on its training data and the parameters set by human creativity.

Definitely took it too high with the temperature, but I really did not think 1.3 (on a scale from 0 to 2) was going to make it react like this. The first few words seem to make sense, until we get to “her inherited success threatens to unnerobelty her eccentric nature.” Unnerobelty – Not a word. We continue to get made-up words and concepts (ABCD doctors). I feel like reading this is going to give me an aneurysm. I’m just going to try with temperature of 1."

    "text": "Let’s try again\nMe: Create the new season of the White Lotus, describing the characters, plot, location, and description. After this, give a detailed journey on how the season unfolds.\nGPT: Title: White Lotus: Hidden Palms\nLocation: This season of White Lotus is set on the exclusive, secluded, and glamorous Hidden Palms resort nestled on the soft sandy beaches of Barbados. Painted with extraordinary views of sapphire seas, vernal mountains, and exuberant gardens, Hidden Palms has its way of binding together the rich, the influential, and the whimsical celebrities from around the globe.\nCharacters:\n\nDiane Weston: A high-spirited, luxury resort critic renowned for her exceptional taste and meticulous reviews. She treads into the resort with her incoming storm of criticism and her facade of high spirits.\nMartin Bohale: A decorated espionage novelist seeking solitude to work on his next magnum opus.\nThe McCallisters: A wealthy yet dysfunctional family replete with squabbles and secrets, coming to escape their stresses back home.\nJackie Haynes: A high-profile tech entrepreneur seeking a breather from her frenzied lifestyle and overflowing media attention.\nThe resort staff: A motley crew of colorful characters, including the haughty hotel manager, the clandestine maid, the mysterious bartender, and the charismatic but secretive entertainment director.\n\nPlot:\nAs the sun-kissed resort welcomes its guests, every vacationer brings along a suitcase of secrets, vices, and ulterior motives. Spiraling through laughter, heartbreak, deceit, and revelation, these dramas intricately interweave, culminating in a shocking revelation - a mysterious death at the resort.\nDiane puts up her ebullient quirks while secretly penning her crushing review. Martin finds uncommon distractions in Jackie, who is not just a picturesque diversion but someone with her own secretive baggage. The McCallisters encapsulate their accumulated stress into hidden tensions that manifest as frequent flare-ups. The staff pivots through the guests’ drama whilst maintaining their flawless service.\nUnfolding the Season:\nParallel to the guests’ narrative, the resort staff grapples with working under a tyrannical manager, concealing their private lives, forging unlikely alliances, and managing guests’ demands. When the initial days see guests unwinding, hinting towards their confrontations, the staff too unfolds their past baggage.\nDiane starts investigating the underbelly of Hidden Palms, feeding off juicy bits from the disgruntled employees for her viral review. Jackie and Martin’s unexpected camaraderie creates waves, provoking unforeseen incidents in the group. Meanwhile, the McCallister’s troubles reach a boiling point resulting in a public breakdown.\nAs the private lives of guests and staff begin to unravel, a tragic accident occurs - one of the guests is found dead. The idyllic facade of Hidden Palms turns into a giant crime scene, shoving everyone present into a whirlpool of suspicion, turning everyone’s life upside down.\nSolving this mystery ties together the rest of the season, with each episode unravelling clues from unexpected quarters. As the vacation transforms into a quest to uncover the truth - suspicions arise, secrets are unveiled, and relationships are tested while the idyllic resort transforms into a riveting thriller landscape. The tropical escape ends with an array of shocking revelations and twisted justice, setting the stage for another vacation in a forthcoming season.\nThere we go; a lot better with a temperature of 1. If White Lotus were to have a generalized formula to develop its plot and characters, GPT seems like it would be following that formula here. It introduces a diverse cast with intriguing backgrounds, and weaves together personal secrets as well as a mysterious death, keeping true to the show’s themes of privilege and hidden truths. While the narrative is engaging and for sure fits the mold of the series so far (definitely more generalized ideas though), the depth and societal commentary characteristic of it would still need a human writer’s touch for full realization."

Doesn’t include any words or imply that it is a TV show at all.\nSo, I wanted to try again. I want to the ChatGPT website itself and put the same prompt of “Create a poster in anticipation of this show” with the description following. Here’s the result:\n\nThere we go, a lot better, now I’m excited. What show should be next?"
