The difficulty in these sports lies in the physical demands, mental fortitude, technical skills required, and the competitiveness of the sport. In no particular order, here are the top 10 hardest sports to play:\n\n1. Gymnastics:\nGymnastics demands exceptional strength, flexibility, coordination, and balance. The level of concentration required to perform intricate routines on apparatus like the vault or balance beam is immense. For example, executing a flawless balance beam routine, where one wrong move can lead to a fall, requires immense focus and precision.\n\n2. Ice Hockey:\nIce hockey is a physically demanding sport, combining speed, skill, and toughness. Players must possess excellent skating ability, hand-eye coordination, and quick decision-making skills. Enduring intense physical contact, while staying focused on puck control and teamwork, make it an arduous sport. Take the example of a player attempting to score a goal in a crowded net, facing the opposition's defensemen and a goalie who is also trying to block the shot.\n\n3. Tennis:\nTennis demands exceptional hand-eye coordination, agility, and mental resilience. Players must possess accurate timing and footwork to return difficult shots. Maintaining focus and composure during long matches requires tremendous mental fortitude. For instance, in a high-pressure situation, a tennis player needs to execute a perfect drop shot while under constant pressure from their opponent.\n\n4. Rugby:\nRugby is a physically grueling contact sport, requiring strength, endurance, and skill. Players must possess exceptional cardiovascular fitness, as they endure rigorous physical challenges such as tackles, rucks, and scrums. The ability to make split-second decisions while under intense physical pressure makes rugby an extremely challenging sport. For example, a player evading multiple opponents and passing the ball precisely to a teammate requires immense skill and determination.\n\n5. Golf:\nGolf may not be as physically demanding as some other sports, but its difficulty lies in the mental aspect and precision required. Golfers need to analyze the course, calculate wind and other factors, and choose the right club for each shot. Executing a golf swing, combining power and control, requires years of practice. For instance, attempting to hit a long drive while avoiding water hazards and aiming accurately for placement on a challenging fairway is a considerable challenge in the game of golf.\n\n6. Formula 1 Racing:\nFormula 1 racing demands top physical conditioning, lightning-fast reflexes, and exceptional mental concentration. Drivers must withstand the high G-forces experienced during races while maintaining precise control over their vehicles. The ability to make split-second decisions while driving at extremely high speeds is a significant challenge. One example is making a decisive pass in a tight corner without colliding with other drivers.\n\n7. Water Polo:\nWater polo combines the physical demands of swimming with the dynamic and fast-paced nature of team sports. Players need exceptional swimming ability, endurance, strength, and the ability to hold their breath. Performing while treading water and adapting to constantly changing game situations make it incredibly challenging. For instance, a player needs to stay afloat, evade defenders, and accurately pass the ball to a teammate while under pressure.\n\n8. Alpine Skiing:\nAlpine skiing requires exceptional technique, strength, balance, and courage. Skiers face high speeds, varying terrain, and unpredictable weather conditions. Negotiating steep, icy slopes while maintaining control and avoiding obstacles demands both physical and mental prowess. For example, navigating a challenging downhill course, making quick turns, and managing the pressure of the race is a daunting task.\n\n9. Cricket:\nCricket is a complex sport that demands a combination of physical fitness, hand-eye coordination, concentration, and strategic thinking. Both batsmen and bowlers face intense pressure to perform under various match situations. Batsmen need to adapt quickly to different ball deliveries and accurately hit them, while bowlers need to aim accurately and anticipate the batsman's moves. An example would be a batsman facing fierce fast bowling and trying to time his shot perfectly against a bowler who is capable of delivering tricky variations.\n\n10. Decathlon:\nThe decathlon is an all-encompassing athletic competition requiring competitors to excel in ten different track and field events over two days. Competitors must possess a high level of skill, strength, speed, and endurance across multiple disciplines. Juggling event schedules, staying injury-free, and maintaining concentration throughout the competition make the decathlon extremely challenging. One example is a competitor pushing through exhaustion to deliver a solid performance in the final event, the 1,500-meter race, where mental and physical fatigue is at its peak.\n\nIt is necessary to note that the ranking of these sports may vary depending on personal opinion and individual strengths and weaknesses."

It's essential for investors to conduct thorough research and carefully consider their risk tolerance before engaging in short selling.\n\nHere are 10 mid cap public stocks that are potential candidates for short selling, along with a brief rationale and anticipated price in 6 months based on current financial trends and market conditions:\n\n1. **Airbnb Inc. (ABNB)**\n   - Current Price: $160.00\n   - Rationale: Airbnb's business heavily relies on travel and tourism, both of which have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As travel restrictions continue and economic uncertainty persists, Airbnb's revenue is likely to remain under pressure.\n   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $120.00\n\n2. **Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER)**\n   - Current Price: $44.50\n   - Rationale: With ongoing regulatory challenges, labor disputes, and increasing competition in the ride-sharing and food delivery markets, Uber faces operational and profitability concerns in the medium term.\n   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $35.00\n\n3. **American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL)**\n   - Current Price: $21.10\n   - Rationale: The airline industry continues to face uncertainty due to the pandemic-induced travel restrictions and reduced demand for air travel. American Airlines' high debt levels and operating expenses further weaken its financial outlook.\n   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $16.00\n\n4. **Carnival Corporation & Plc (CCL)**\n   - Current Price: $22.75\n   - Rationale: Cruise operators like Carnival have experienced significant disruptions to their operations due to the pandemic. With ongoing concerns about virus outbreaks onboard and limited resumption of cruises, Carnival's revenue generation remains constrained.\n   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $18.00\n\n5. **Dropbox Inc. (DBX)**\n   - Current Price: $31.20\n   - Rationale: Dropbox faces intense competition in the cloud storage and collaboration space, which puts pressure on its pricing power and market share. Moreover, the shift towards remote work may lead to slower growth in paid user acquisition.\n   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $25.00\n\n6. **PagerDuty Inc. (PD)**\n   - Current Price: $40.75\n   - Rationale: PagerDuty operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving IT operations management sector. As businesses reassess their technology spending and investments, PagerDuty may face challenges in expanding its customer base.\n   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $30.00\n\n7. **Square Inc. (SQ)**\n   - Current Price: $250.60\n   - Rationale: Square's stock has rallied significantly, leading to a high valuation relative to its financial performance. As macroeconomic conditions change and competition intensifies in the digital payments industry, there may be downward pressure on Square's stock price.\n   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $200.00\n\n8. **Wendy's Company (WEN)**\n   - Current Price: $19.40\n   - Rationale: Wendy's faces challenges in its fast-food segment, with increased competition, changing consumer preferences, and cost pressures affecting its profitability. Slower sales recovery compared to peers may impact Wendy's stock performance.\n   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $15.00\n\n9. **Under Armour Inc. (UAA)**\n   - Current Price: $21.80\n   - Rationale: Under Armour's struggles with brand positioning, inventory management, and sluggish growth in its key markets have weighed on its financial performance. Regulatory scrutiny and changing consumer trends pose additional risks.\n   - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $18.00\n\n10. **Nordstrom Inc. (JWN)**\n    - Current Price: $26.90\n    - Rationale: Nordstrom operates in the competitive retail sector, facing challenges from online competitors and shifting consumer preferences. The company's high debt levels and store closures may impact its ability to sustain profitability.\n    - Anticipated Price in 6 Months: $20.00\n\nPlease note that the anticipated prices in 6 months are based on the assumptions and analysis available at the time of writing and may not accurately reflect the future stock performance. It is essential to conduct further due diligence and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions."

Diane Weston: A high-spirited, luxury resort critic renowned for her exceptional taste and meticulous reviews. She treads into the resort with her incoming storm of criticism and her facade of high spirits. \n\n2.

Spiraling through laughter, heartbreak, deceit, and revelation, these dramas intricately interweave, culminating in a shocking revelation - a mysterious death at the resort.\n\nDiane puts up her ebullient quirks while secretly penning her crushing review. Martin finds uncommon distractions in Jackie, who is not just a picturesque diversion but someone with her own secretive baggage.

When the initial days see guests unwinding, hinting towards their confrontations, the staff too unfolds their past baggage.\n\nDiane starts investigating the underbelly of Hidden Palms, feeding off juicy bits from the disgruntled employees for her viral review. Jackie and Martin's unexpected camaraderie creates waves, provoking unforeseen incidents in the group. Meanwhile, the McCallister's troubles reach a boiling point resulting in a public breakdown. \n\nAs the private lives of guests and staff begin to unravel, a tragic accident occurs - one of the guests is found dead. The idyllic facade of Hidden Palms turns into a giant crime scene, shoving everyone present into a whirlpool of suspicion, turning everyone's life upside down.\n\nSolving this mystery ties together the rest of the season, with each episode unravelling clues from unexpected quarters. As the vacation transforms into a quest to uncover the truth - suspicions arise, secrets are unveiled, and relationships are tested while the idyllic resort transforms into a riveting thriller landscape.
